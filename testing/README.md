# stmvdev

Advanced, exploratory methods researching the use of the spatiotemporal models (stmv) R-package: kernal-based lattice models that  divide and conquer large space-time modelling and prediction problems. A local space-time operator/filter is used with a global covariate model. It is therefore, an hierarchical model.
